# Transfer-Learning-with-PyTorch
---

This project applies transfer learning techniques using PyTorch to perform image classification tasks with pre-trained convolutional neural networks. By leveraging models like ResNet and VGG, the code fine-tunes deep features on a custom dataset to achieve efficient and accurate classification with reduced training time. The project includes data loading, model adaptation, training, evaluation, and visualization, making it a practical introduction to transfer learning in real-world deep learning workflows.
